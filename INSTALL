Net::UPS
=============================================================================

INSTALLATION
-----

To run the test scripts make sure to create a file ".upsrc" in your home
directory with at least the following content:

UPSUserID   yourUserId
UPSPassword yourPassword
UPSAccessKey yourAccessKey

Once that's done, run the following sequence of commands:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

If you prefer not to run the tests, you can skip "make test" in the above sequence.
